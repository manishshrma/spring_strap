ques.Difference between applicationcontext and beanfactory?
ans->////////https://stackoverflow.com/questions/243385/beanfactory-vs-applicationcontext

if parent class have instances of other classes

ex-
class traingle{

Point pointa;
Point pointb;
}
then even if you make Point class as prototype(whiich does create new instances everytime you call)

but as traingle class is singleton so won't create new instances for Point claass everytime you call it
//thus we use Applicationcontextaware
ques; difference betweem applicationcontext close method vs applicationcontext registershutdownhook
///https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42018044/what-is-the-difference-between-registershutdownhook-and-close
--inshort close() - it close the application context immediatelly, while registershutdownhook close the application context when the jvm end.
//Bean post processor
Just before bean is initialize(or going to initialize)-->BeanPostProcess interface postprocessBeforeInitialization run
and after bean get initialized in context---> //     //       //            //       postprocessAfterInitialization run
so it is clear, that class that implement the BeanPosprocess interface get initialize in the context first. it is only class that initialize
at the very first moment.
///BeanFactoryPostProcessor
bean factory get called first.
//@Required

this annotation is used on for those members that need to defined. @required is checked by beanpostprocessor, now RequiredAnnotationBeanPostprocessor
is a class that need to be configured cause it use BeanPostProcess which further check if any member is @Requried
